This is the story about Taylor trying to test GitFlow.  She loves programming and is used to SVN already.  

Along with Taylor, her bff Katy is completely against the implementation fo Git.  She is comfortable in Sourcesafe and does not see any incentive to move to Git.

Taylor loves to propose new ideas for programming.  In this code snippet, she will show how to catch exceptions (in Python)

String TryToCaptureResource(void)
{
  captureResult = "Failed, unknown error"
  
  try
  {
    captureResource()
  }
  catch (resourceUnavailableException)
  {
    OutputErrorToConsole()
  }
  catch (resourceDoesNotExistException)
  {
    OutputErrorToConsole()
  }
  
  return captureResult 
  
} 

However, Katy is always a naysayer.
